refactored from the mjkoster/SmartObject repository on 12/5/2013

Note: The code in this repo is a snapshot and has not been synced to my latest development tree. I am simplifying the API structure and adding more support for IETF CoRE/CoAP/RD. I'll do a pull of a working new version soon (May 2014) Please contact me if you are interested in working on IoT Toolkit.
